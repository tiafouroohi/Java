    <div id="basics"><h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely
        popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum
        flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of diferent directions. Javascript lives inside
        a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these
        environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="">Variable Declaration</a> variables are containers for storing data values- imagine a cup you fill with
        coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be
        identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. var x;</li>
        <li><a href="">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operaters assign values to JavaScript variables- our cup can
        now have coffee poured in it, giving out variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator
        assigns a value to a variable. var x=10;</li>
        <li><a href="">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on varriables you need
        to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean-
        true or false; null- null aka nothing; Number- 42 or 3.14159; String-"Coding Dojo Rocks!"
        Array- {1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo']: and Object- {first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</li>
        <li><a href="">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different
        decisions- hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met.
        You can you conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following
        conditional statements: if a specificed condition is true, do this code in our code block;
        else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; else we execute
        this block of code;</li>
        <li><a href="">Loops</a> there are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all
        essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you
        have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a
        loop!</li>
        <li><a href="">Function</a>Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will
        run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are
        putting together a desk from Ikea, we open the instruction manual and get started, first we
        screw the legs to the tbale top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished
        our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and
        over again.</li>
